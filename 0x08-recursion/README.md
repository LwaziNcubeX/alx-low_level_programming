# 0x08. C - Recursion

This project contains my solutions to various tasks related to recursion in C programming language. The tasks were part of the curriculum at ALX Low Level Programming course.

## What is recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is a powerful technique that allows us to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller and simpler sub-problems.

## Tasks

The following tasks were completed as part of this project:

### 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

.

### 1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together

.

### 2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

.

### 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling



### 4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

.

### 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

.

### 6. Inception. Is it possible?

.

## Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful programming technique that allows us to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller and simpler sub-problems. The tasks in this project helped me to better understand how recursion works and how it can be used to solve various problems.

All of my solutions to the tasks can be found in the respective C files in this repository.
