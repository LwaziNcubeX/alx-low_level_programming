# ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING

This repository contains my solutions to various C programming projects. These projects were part of the curriculum at the ALX SE PROGRAM.

## What is C programming?

C programming is a widely-used programming language that is known for its efficiency and versatility. It was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs for use in the Unix operating system. C is a general-purpose language that can be used to create a wide range of software applications, from simple programs to complex systems. It has a simple syntax and provides low-level access to memory, making it suitable for systems programming and embedded systems. C programming is also the foundation for many other programming languages, and it is still widely used today in various industries.
